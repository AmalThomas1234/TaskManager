The MERN Stack Task Manager project is a backend-based web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides users with the ability to manage their tasks efficiently, allowing them to add, edit, and mark tasks as complete.

Features:


Task Management: Users can create tasks with details such as title, description.
Task Listing: Display a list of tasks for each user, categorized by status (e.g., pending, completed).
Task Editing: Allow users to edit existing tasks to update information or mark them as complete.
Task Deletion: Provide the option for users to delete tasks they no longer need.
RESTful API: Develop a RESTful API using Express.js to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.
MongoDB Database: Utilize MongoDB as the database to store task data persistently.
React.js Frontend: Build a responsive and user-friendly frontend using React.js to interact with the backend API.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to users.
Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
